              <h3><i>UNIQUE STUDIOS PRESENTS</i></h3>
              <p>In photography there is a reality so subtle that it becomes more real than reality.Photography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving. What you have caught on film is captured forever… It remembers little things, long after you have forgotten everything</p>

              <h3><u>* Memories are never old </u></h3>
              <p>The most beautiful things are not associated with money; they are memories and moments. If you don't celebrate those, they can pass you by.We all have our time machines. Some take us back, they're called memories. Some take us forward, they're called dreams</p>

            <h3><u>* Feel the Mounntains</u></h3>
            <p>Somewhere between the bottom of the climb and the summit is the answer to the mystery why we climb.The great thing about reaching the top of the mountain is realising that there’s space for more than one person. And you’re now in the prime position to help others up.</p>

            <h3><u>* The Art of Camera</u></h3>
            <p>For me, the camera is a sketch book, an instrument of intuition and spontaneity.photograph is to hold one's breath, when all faculties converge to capture fleeting reality. It's at that precise moment that mastering an image becomes a great physical and intellectual joy</p>

          <h3><u>* Beauty of Nature</u></h3>
          <p> In nature, nothing is perfect and everything is perfect. Trees can be contorted, bent in weird ways, and they're still beautiful.Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.Forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair. </p>

          <h3><u>*  Eiffel Tower </u></h3>
          <p>Every time I look at the Eiffel Tower, it completely blows my mind.…It looked very different from the Statue of Liberty, but what did that matter? What was the good of having the statue without the liberty, the freedom to go where one chose if one was held back by one’s color? No, I preferred the Eiffel Tower, which made no promises.</p>
